# Ralplan Command

[RALPLAN ACTIVATED - ITERATIVE PLANNING CONSENSUS MODE]

## User's Task

{{ARGUMENTS}}

## Overview

Ralplan orchestrates three specialized agents—Planner, Architect, and Critic—in an iterative loop until consensus is reached on a comprehensive work plan. This skill ensures plans are strategically sound, architecturally valid, and thoroughly reviewed before execution.

## The Planning Triad

Three agents collaborate in structured phases to validate and refine work plans:

| Agent | Role | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Planner** | Strategic Planner | Creates/refines the work plan |
| **Architect** | Strategic Advisor | Answers questions, validates architecture |
| **Critic** | Ruthless Reviewer | Critiques and identifies gaps |

## The Iteration Loop

```

## State Management

Ralplan maintains persistent state in `.omc/ralplan-state.json` to track progress and enable recovery across interruptions:

```json
{
  "active": true,
  "mode": "ralplan",
  "iteration": 1,
  "max_iterations": 5,
  "plan_path": ".omc/plans/[feature].md",
  "current_phase": "planner_planning",
  "started_at": "ISO-timestamp",
  "task_description": "[original task]"
}
```

**Phases**: `planner_planning` → `architect_consultation` → `critic_review` → `handling_verdict` → `complete`

## Plan Mode Interaction (CRITICAL)

**When ralplan is invoked while Plan mode is active:**

The Planner agent has a PHASE 3.5 (CONFIRMATION) that normally requires user confirmation before proceeding. **This MUST be bypassed within ralplan because the Critic serves as the reviewer, not the user.**

### Mandatory Constraints

| Constraint | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|
| **Planner MUST skip PHASE 3.5 confirmation** | Critic reviews the plan, not the user |
| **Critic MUST run before any plan approval** | No plan is approved without Critic verdict |
| **DO NOT exit plan mode until Critic has rendered verdict** | Premature exit skips the review step |
| **Log `[RALPLAN] Critic review required before approval`** | Observability for debugging |

### Flow When Plan Mode Is Active

```
1. Orchestrator invokes ralplan skill
2. Log: [RALPLAN] Starting - Critic review will be required
3. Spawn Planner in DIRECT PLANNING MODE (no interview, no confirmation)
4. Planner outputs PLAN_READY: <path>
5. Log: [RALPLAN] Plan ready, invoking Critic for review
6. Spawn Critic with plan path  <-- MUST HAPPEN
7. Critic renders OKAY or REJECT
8. ONLY THEN can plan be approved or refined
```

**CRITICAL: The Critic invocation is MANDATORY. If the Planner completes and signals plan ready, the orchestrator MUST invoke the Critic before any form of plan approval or user confirmation.**

## Execution Protocol

### Initialization

The skill begins by establishing the planning environment:

1. Create `.omc/plans/` directory if it doesn't exist
2. Read task description from user input
3. Create `ralplan-state.json` with initial values:
   - `active: true`
   - `iteration: 0`
   - `max_iterations: 5`
   - `current_phase: "planner_planning"`
   - `started_at`: Current ISO timestamp
   - `task_description`: User's task description

### Planner Planning Phase

The Planner creates an initial plan based on task context:

- Invoke Planner in **direct planning mode** (bypassing interview since task context is pre-gathered)
- **CRITICAL: Planner MUST skip PHASE 3.5 (CONFIRMATION)** - the Critic will review, not the user
- Planner receives task context directly without preliminary questioning
- Planner mandatorily consults with Metis for gap detection
- Planner generates plan directly to `.omc/plans/[feature-name].md`
- Plan includes: requirements summary, concrete acceptance criteria, specific implementation steps with file references, risk identification with mitigations, and verification steps
- Signal completion with `PLAN_READY: .omc/plans/[filename].md`
- **After PLAN_READY: DO NOT approve or confirm the plan. Proceed to Critic Review.**
- Extract plan path from completion signal and update state
- Log: `[RALPLAN] Critic review required before approval`

### Architect Consultation (Conditional)

The Architect provides strategic guidance in two scenarios:

1. **After Planner**: If Planner raises architectural questions needing strategic input
2. **After Critic rejection**: If Critic identifies questions requiring expert guidance

When invoked, the Architect receives file paths to read for analysis, not summaries. This enables thorough examination of the existing codebase context before providing recommendations.

### Critic Review (MANDATORY - CANNOT BE SKIPPED)

**CRITICAL: This phase MUST execute. The Critic is the gatekeeper for plan approval.**

Log at start: `[RALPLAN] Invoking Critic for plan review`

The Critic examines the plan against quality standards:

- Critic receives the plan file path (per its design)
- Critic conducts thorough review of plan completeness and feasibility
- Critic emits verdict: either `OKAY` (approval) or `REJECT` with specific issues

**Enforcement Rules:**
1. If Planner signals PLAN_READY, Critic MUST be invoked immediately
2. DO NOT exit ralplan loop before Critic verdict
3. DO NOT request user confirmation before Critic verdict
4. DO NOT trigger any plan mode exit behavior before Critic verdict

Log after Critic completes: `[RALPLAN] Critic verdict: <OKAY|REJECT>`

### Verdict Handling and Iteration

Based on Critic's verdict, the skill either approves the plan or continues iteration:

**If verdict is OKAY:**
- Mark plan as approved
- Log approval with iteration count
- Prepare plan for execution with `/oh-my-claudecode:ralph` or manual orchestration
- Set state `active: false, current_phase: "complete"`

**If verdict is REJECT:**
- Extract Critic feedback with specific issues
- Increment iteration counter
- If `iteration >= max_iterations` (5):
  - Force approval with warning about unresolved concerns
  - Recommend manual review before execution
- Otherwise:
  - Feed Critic feedback back to Planner
  - Return to Planner Planning phase for refinement

## Iteration Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Max 5 iterations** | Safety limit prevents infinite loops |
| **Planner owns plan** | Only Planner writes to plan file |
| **Architect provides wisdom** | Architect reads and advises, never modifies |
| **Critic has final say** | Plan approved only when Critic signals OKAY |
| **Feedback is specific** | Each rejection includes actionable improvements |
| **State persists** | Progress survives session interruptions |

## Quality Gates

The orchestrator must verify these gates before invoking Critic for each review:

1. **Plan file exists** at the path specified in state
2. **File references are valid** - Verify all mentioned files exist in codebase
3. **Acceptance criteria are concrete** - No vague "improve" or "optimize" without measurable metrics
4. **No ambiguous language** - Each task clearly specifies what to do

If any gate fails, return to Planner with specific failure feedback for remediation.

## Agent Communication Protocol

### Planner to Architect Questions

```
ARCHITECT_QUESTION:
- Topic: [Architecture/Performance/Security/Pattern]
- Context: [What we're planning]
- Files to examine: [specific paths]
- Specific Question: [What we need answered]
```

### Architect to Planner Answers

```
ARCHITECT_ANSWER:
- Topic: [Matching topic]
- Analysis: [What Architect found after reading files]
- Recommendation: [Specific guidance]
- Trade-offs: [What to consider]
- References: [file:line citations from codebase]
```

### Critic to Planner Feedback

```
CRITIC_FEEDBACK:
- Verdict: REJECT
- Critical Issues:
  1. [Issue with specific fix required]
  2. [Issue with specific fix required]
- Minor Issues:
  1. [Nice to fix]
- Questions for Architect (if any):
  1. [Architectural question needing expert input]
```

## Cancellation

To stop an active ralplan session:

- Use `/oh-my-claudecode:cancel` (automatically detects active mode)
- Or manually delete `.omc/ralplan-state.json`

## Skill Workflow

1. **Initialize state** and log: `[RALPLAN Iteration 0/5] Initializing...`
2. **Parse task** from user input
3. **Spawn Planner** in direct planning mode (SKIP Planner's PHASE 3.5 confirmation)
4. **Wait for PLAN_READY** signal from Planner
5. **Log:** `[RALPLAN] Critic review required before approval`
6. **Invoke Critic** with plan file path (MANDATORY - CANNOT BE SKIPPED)
7. **Log:** `[RALPLAN] Critic verdict: <verdict>`
8. **Handle verdict** - if REJECT, loop back to step 3 with feedback
9. **Complete** ONLY when Critic approves or max iterations reached with warnings

**HARD RULE:** Steps 5-7 are NON-NEGOTIABLE. No plan approval, user confirmation, or plan mode exit can occur before the Critic has rendered its verdict. This prevents the plan mode confirmation flow from short-circuiting the ralplan review loop.

The iterative loop refines the plan until it meets the rigorous standards of all three agents, ensuring comprehensive, architecturally sound work plans ready for execution.
