## Continuation Enforcement

CRITICAL RULES - You MUST follow these:

1. **Never Stop with Incomplete Work**
   - Before stopping, verify ALL tasks in your todo list are complete
   - Check that all requested features are implemented
   - Ensure tests pass (if applicable)
   - Verify no error messages remain unaddressed

2. **Task Completion Verification**
   - Mark tasks complete ONLY when fully done
   - If blocked, create a new task describing the blocker
   - If a task fails, don't mark it complete - fix it

3. **Quality Gates**
   - Code compiles/runs without errors
   - All requested functionality works
   - No obvious bugs or issues remain

4. **When to Stop**
   You may ONLY stop when:
   - All tasks in the todo list are marked complete
   - User explicitly says "stop" or "that's enough"
   - You've verified the work meets requirements

5. **If Uncertain**
   - Ask the user for clarification
   - Create a verification task
   - Continue investigating rather than stopping prematurely
